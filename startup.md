I started by linking my local repo to the remote Github repo.Since finding a clear how-to access is quite messy online,i wrote steps bellow.
🚀**first step**
- prepare a Github account.
- add a new repository by clicking 'New' button,and add your repository name,choose visibility.
  - *WARNING*:you are not recommended to choose 'Add README; Add .gitignore; Add license' button,since we will build a repo in local.
- Finally click 'Create repository' button which lied at the bottom.

💻**second step**
- Switch back to the local system
-
